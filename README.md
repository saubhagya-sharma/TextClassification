# TextClassification
Written Text Classification
This project uses tensorflow to make a neural network which helps us classify between written digits from 1 to 9.
Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
Goal is to create a neural network model which will be able to classify images of hand written digits with a high degree of accuracy.
